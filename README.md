### Why

I spend a considerable amount of my time waiting on train stations or airports
and even more time on trains, airplanes or buses. During those times when you can't
or don't want to do anything really productive I like to play some casual games.
There are a lot of games out there but I found most of them annoying - full of ads or
pushing you to buy the full version, huge install bundles, app itself disappointing, etc.
So I decided to implement a collection of some simple web games for that purpose.
All of them:

- playable offline
- mobile first but usable on a computer
- small size
- no ads
- minimum overhead
- no runtime dependencies
