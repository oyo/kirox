### About

A collection of classic casual games to waste time when there's nothing better to do.

Design goals:

- free
- no ads
- small size
- easy to use
- minimal loading time
- playable offline (after initial load)
- mobile first but can be played on a computer
- no runtime dependencies
- no rewards for playing more often
- open source with permissive license
- appealing presentation (I tried at least...)

### Credits

Thanks to the original authors for some resources.
