### Why

I spend a considerable amount of my time waiting on train stations or airports
and even more time on trains, airplanes or buses. During those times when you can't
or don't want to do start anything productive I like to play some casual games.
There are a lot of games out there but I found most of them annoying - full of ads,
pushing you to buy full version or daily login, huge install bundles, content
disappointing, etc.
So I decided to implement a collection of some simple web games for myself.
All of them:

- no ads
- small size
- easy to use
- minimal loading time
- playable 100% offline (after initial load)
- mobile first but can be used on a computer
- no runtime dependencies
- no rewards for playing more often
- open source with permissive license
- appealing presentation (that's what I tried at least...)
